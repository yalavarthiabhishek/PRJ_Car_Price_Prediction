# PRJ_Car_Price_Prediction
 In this project, Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib were utilized for data manipulation purposes. The dataset underwent exploratory data analysis, handling of missing values, and categorical variable encoding. Several regression models, including RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, and ExtraTreesRegressor, were trained, and their performance was evaluated using metrics like R2 score and mean absolute error. The RandomForestRegressor model was further optimized using RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, CatBoostRegressor was employed for modeling purposes. The trained CatBoostRegressor model was saved using pickle. This project highlights skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and hyperparameter optimization.
